# Primus

Working version of the Barnes-Hut NBody simulator in the Cpp repository. 

Primus now uses SFML for real-time rendering of the simulation. It is built to be run from the command line, along with a number of optional flags.

A CUDA accelerated version of the program will be added eventually. Currently, cuda is a bit of a nightmare to work with across systems.
